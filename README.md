# Challenges and Thoughts
## Exercise 1
* *Time taken*: about 3 hours
* Requires the YouTube Data API, and it took a little while to just
  to read through the API documentation.
* Validating the URL was a lot trickier than I had first thought. There were
  quite a few cases to check for. I spent a good amount of time just typing
  in sample URLs into the browser bar.
* Validation took approximately 75% of the time it took to write the file.
  The request from the YouTube API was straightforward once I was familiar
  with the API.
